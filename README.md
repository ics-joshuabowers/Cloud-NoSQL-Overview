# Cloud NoSQL Overview

## Abstract
Have you found yourself asking "Which NoSQL database should I use?" or "How do these different paradigms work?" Then this presentation is for you. With so many options it can be difficult to decide whether you go with a property graph, document, or a key value database.  Here we will use a few examples to explore how they each work and how you can represent similar data in different ways.

## Model
Below is a high level overview of the model that will be used in the graph, document, and key value examples.
