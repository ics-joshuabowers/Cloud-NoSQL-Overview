# Document Databases

We will be using some generated data to show how crazy you can get with hierarchies within a document.

To go through the example you will need to have a SageMaker notebook created that has access to DocumentDB, see root README for details. Once that is setup start the notebook and import the notebook from this directory to the SageMaker notebook and open it. Then you should be able to run through the examples and even create your own.

Would love to add some more complex queries/aggregations to this workbook so if you to submit a PR!
